                <p>SAPUI5-Deployer is a solution for deploying SAPUI5 and OpenUI5 web apps to a SAP ABAP Web Application Server automatically. It is designed to simplify the developer workflow by automating the following steps.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download of Github Archive</li>
                    <li>Remove wrapper subdirectory from archive</li>
                    <li>Minify CSS & Javascript files</li>
                    <li>Build Component-preload.js file where required</li>
                    <li>Recursively perform above steps for any required Github submodules</li>
                    <li>Package up all artifacts into a deployment archive</li>
                    <li>Optionally save deployment archive to file system</li>
                    <li>Deploy to SAP Internet Communications Framework</li>
                    <li>Invalidate the UI5 cache buster</li>
                </ul>
                <table style="border:0px;">
                    <tr>
                        <td style="border:0px;"><img src="images/SAPUI5logo.png" width="100%"></td>
                        <td style="border:0px;"><img src="images/OpenUI5_newlogo.png" width="60%"></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h1>
<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements</h1>
                <p>This solution was originally built on a SAP WAS ABAP 7.31 SP5 system with the SAP_UI software component also installed. There is no reason it should not work on all releases that have the SAP provided function module <code>/ui5/ui5_repository_load_http</code>.</p>
                <p>Most recently the code was refactored on a SAP WAS ABAP 7.50 SP2 system so you may need to refactor some of the code if you are on an earlier release.</p>
                <p>Installation requires the <a href="http://abapgit.org">abapGit</a> project by <a href="https://github.com/larshp" target="_blank">@larshp</a>.</p>
                <p><img src="images/abapgit.png" /></p>
                <p>Instructions for installing abapGit can be found <a href="http://larshp.github.io/abapGit/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>If you haven't seen abapGit before I highly recommend you take a good look at it. If you find it useful perhaps you could consider joining the project and making your own contributions?</p>
                <h1>  
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>
                <h2>  
<a id="installation1" class="anchor" href="#installation1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SSL setup</h2>
                <p>If you have not performed SSL setup and installation of root certificates as part of the abapGit installation you should do it now - otherwise you can skip this step.</p>
                <p>Refer to the relevant SAP Documentation <a href="https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw70/helpdata/en/65/6a563cef658a06e10000000a11405a/content.htm" target="_blank">Configuring the SAP Web AS for Supporting SSL</a>.</p>
                <p>As you will only be using this code on a development system you may choose to use a self-signed certificate.</p>
                <p>Download the CA root certificate(s) that GitHub uses from <a href="https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm" target="_blank">https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm</a>. You can find which specific certificate GitHub uses from the GitHub documentation or use your web browser to determine it.
                </p>
                <p>Install the certificate(s) in STRUST under "SSL System Client SSL Client (Anonymous)"</p>
                <p>Restart ICM using transaction SMICM</p>
                <p>The certificate list should end up looking something like this:</p>

                <h2>  
<a id="installation1" class="anchor" href="#installation1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clone Repository</h2>
                <p>Use the abapGit `Clone` option to link an ABAP package to my GitHub repository. I recommend using a local package just for this purpose called something like <code>$SAPUI5DEPLOYER</code>. You are very unlikely to want to use a transportable package for this project.</p>
                <p><img src="images/clone.png" /></p>
                <p>Select the `Pull` option to load all the ABAP artifacts into your nominated package.</p>

<a id="usage-instructions" class="anchor" href="#usage-instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How To Use</h1>
                <p>A sample program is included that calls the <code>YCL_GITHIB_DEPLOYER</code> class to deploy the <a href="https://github.com/grahamrobbo/demojam" target="_blank">grahamrobbo/demojam</a> repository. Check the <a href="https://github.com/grahamrobbo/demojam/blob/master/.Ui5RepositoryUploadParameters" target="_blank">.Ui5RepositoryUploadParameters</a> file to see where the app will be deployed to.</p>
                <pre><code>REPORT ygithub_deploy_test.

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK blk_main.
PARAMETERS:
  git_repo TYPE string OBLIGATORY LOWER CASE
    DEFAULT `grahamrobbo/demojam`,
  branch   TYPE string OBLIGATORY LOWER CASE
    DEFAULT `master`,
  test     TYPE boolean DEFAULT 'X'.
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK blk_main.

START-OF-SELECTION.

  TRY.
      ycl_github_deployer=>deploy(
            repository  = git_repo
            branch      = branch
            test_only   = test ).
    CATCH cx_root INTO DATA(exc).
      MESSAGE exc TYPE 'I' DISPLAY LIKE 'E'.
  ENDTRY.
</code></pre>
                <p>The "TEST" flag will build the complete archive but, rather than deploying it, will allow you to save it to your local file system.</p>
                <h1>  
<a id="usage-instructions" class="anchor" href="#continuous-deployment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Continuous Deployment</h1>
                <p>If you want to implement a Continuous Deployment solution so that the SAPUI5 app is automatically deployed when changes are committed I suggest the following two methods.</p>
                <p>If your infrastructure guys will allow HTTP calls from outside your corporate network to be passed through to your development WAS you can build a ICF handler that can be called using a <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/" target="_blank">GitHub Webhook</a> whenever there is a commit or branch merge to master. This HTTP call could pass through a SAP Web Dispatcher or go to another intermediate server that could handle the webhook call. When triggered this handler should check the API call for validity before calling the <code>YCL_GITHUB_DEPLOYER</code> class. In my opinion this is the best way to trigger deployment as the code is only executed when actually required. See sample ICF handler <code>YCL_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_HANDLER</code> for an example.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to use the GitHub Webhook method you can build a program that calls the <a href="https://developer.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub API</a> to see if the SHA-1 hash of the master branch has changed. If it has then the <code>YCL_GITHUB_DEPLOYER</code> class can be called. I suggest storing the SHA-1 hash in a server-side cookie (<code>CL_BSP_SERVER_SIDE_COOKIE</code>) for this purpose. This program would need to be scheduled as a regular background job so that it regularly checks if a deployment is required.</p>

                <p>SAPUI5-Deployer was built in February 2015 and released for Aussie DemoJam 2015 by Graham Robinson (<a href="https://github.com/grahamrobbo" class="user-mention">@grahamrobbo</a>) in May 2015.</p>
                <p>Version 2 - this version - was released in August 2017 primarily to support the use of abapGit to install the repo on yur system.</p>
                <p>Much help came from Michael Moessner - especially with the changes to function module <code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTP</code> and the code to unwrap the Github archive.</p>
                <p>Plenty of inspiration and ideas were generated by Matt Harding(<a href="https://github.com/mattieharding" class="user-mention">@mattieharding</a>) and Nigel James(<a href="https://github.com/njames" class="user-mention">@njames</a>).</p>
                <p>Thanks also to Uwe Fetzer (<a href="https://github.com/se38" class="user-mention">@se38</a>) for his <a href="https://github.com/se38/zJSON">zJSON</a> project which was used in Version 1.</p>
                <p>Thank you</p>
